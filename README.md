This app is a small NodeJS app that takes a PCO(Planning Center Online) song pdf and returns the text of the song.

PDF's are in file directory and need to be changed in input.js.

To run application in console:

`npm run start`

Limitations:
* Not currently dynamic
* Songbook(multiple page pdf) not working, only single page pdf.
* Placement of chords not correct if pdf generated using chordpro.
